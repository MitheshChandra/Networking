Backend Servers & Reverse-Proxy: Think about how you'll structure your Docker Compose file (or Vagrant if you decide on that). For the reverse proxy (using Nginx, for example), look into its basic round-robin configuration. Ask yourself:

How will you define the network so that all containers can talk to each other?

How will you map internal ports to external ones?

Action Tip: Start smallâ€”spin up one backend server and get a simple HTTP request flowing through your reverse-proxy, then scale that setup to include all required backend servers.
